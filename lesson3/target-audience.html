            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>This site is directed toward people who care about planning outdoor activites and wish to know how the
                weather might have
                implications on their plans. Since Idaho has a lot of outdoor activities to do, we would look to
                target those who have interest in outdoor activities and need consistently updated information
                about the weather. Another target audience group would be those who travel and drive often such as
                truckers or those with commutes.
                We would also target local farmers who would be interested to determine how
                they need to take care of their crops and/or animals.</p>
