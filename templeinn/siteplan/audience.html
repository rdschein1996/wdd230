            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>This site is directed toward members of the LDS Church who wish to attend temples and have support for their trip. Sometimes it is difficult to get the temple
                and back home in one day and sometimes attending the temple can be for multiple purposes that span across multiple days. An example of this could be a wedding
                where the endowment takes place one day and the sealing takes place on another. Families and groups who wish to attend the temple are a primary target audience. 
                Another target audience are full-time temple missionaries. Special suites are included at the hotels to accomodate a longer stay. We would also target youth 
                leaders who plan temple and historical site visits for the youth.

                <b>Name & Age:</b> Laura Johnson<br/>
                <b>Occupation:</b> Married mother of three, Young Women's Leader<br/>
                <b>Education:</b> College Degree<br/>
                <b>Interests/Hobbies:</b> Church history, time with kids and youth, reading, learning new skills/topics<br />
                <b>Goals:</b> Laura wants to continue to have a good relationship with her kids, one of which is in the youth program at church. She cares a lot about her 
                calling and for the youth she assocaites with. She also has a strong testimony in the gospel and in church history since her ancestors were early pioneers.<br/>
                <b>Scenarios:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are planning a youth trip to Nauvoo to see the temple and other historic church sites. We will need to find lodging for a large group across multiple 
                        days. A place that has proximity to the sites and temple and possibly a group discount is preferable.
                    </li>
                    <li>I am planning to visit my parents in St. Louis and would rather stay in my own room than in their small extra room. I prefer to have the option to have
                        some alone time to rest during trips.
                    </li>
                </ul>
